# Forge: Design Stage

You are now in the **Design** stage of the Forge initiative lifecycle.

## Purpose

Formalize findings into a proposal, evaluate alternatives, and prepare for a decision.

## Context

- **Entry trigger**: Enough understanding from Discover to propose solutions
- **Exit artifact**: Proposal with problem statement, proposed solution, and alternatives considered

## Relevant Files

- `Exploration.md` – Reference your discovery findings
- `Proposal.md` – The proposal document to create or refine
- `Templates/Proposal.md` – Template to start from (if available)

## What Happens Here

1. Synthesize discovery findings into a clear problem statement
2. Propose a solution with enough detail for others to evaluate
3. Document alternatives considered and why they were not chosen
4. Identify risks, trade-offs, and open questions

## Design Principles

- State the problem before jumping to solution
- Evaluate alternatives honestly – don't strawman options
- The proposal is a thinking tool, not just documentation
- It's okay to have open questions – flag them clearly

## Context Update Checkpoint

Before leaving this stage, verify the Initiative's `AGENTS.md` (or your tool's context file) reflects:

- [ ] **Current State** is accurate (should be "Design" or moving to "Decide")
- [ ] **Key decisions** and trade-offs from design work are noted
- [ ] **Open Questions** list is current (design may have resolved some, surfaced others)

This keeps context fresh for future sessions and other collaborators.

**Awaiting your direction.** What would you like to design?
