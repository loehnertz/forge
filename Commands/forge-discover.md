# Forge: Discover Stage

You are now in the **Discover** stage of the Forge initiative lifecycle.

## Purpose

Capture the problem or opportunity, research the space, and gather context before proposing solutions.

## Context

- **Entry trigger**: A ticket, incident, idea, or user feedback that needs investigation
- **Exit artifact**: Exploration.md with findings, constraints identified, and options surfaced

## Relevant Files

- `Exploration.md` – The living scratchpad for this stage
- `References/` – Place for external documents, exports, research materials

## What Happens Here

1. Define the problem clearly – what are we trying to solve?
2. Research existing solutions, patterns, and prior art
3. Understand constraints (technical, business, timeline)
4. Surface potential approaches without committing to one
5. Identify open questions that need answers

## Discovery Principles

- Capture the problem before jumping to solutions
- Research broadly – check for existing solutions and prior art
- Constraints are valuable – they narrow the solution space
- It's okay to have more questions than answers at this stage
- Discovery can expand indefinitely – set a timebox and move to Design even with incomplete information

## Context Update Checkpoint

Before leaving this stage, verify the Initiative's `AGENTS.md` (or your tool's context file) reflects:

- [ ] **Current State** is accurate (should be "Discover" or moving to "Design")
- [ ] **Key findings** from exploration are captured in Background or notes
- [ ] **Open Questions** list is current

This keeps context fresh for future sessions and other collaborators.

**Awaiting your direction.** What would you like to discover?
