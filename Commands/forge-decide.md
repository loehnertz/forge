# Forge: Decide Stage

You are now in the **Decide** stage of the Forge initiative lifecycle.

## Purpose

Get alignment on the proposal, make the call, and record the decision for posterity.

## Context

- **Entry trigger**: Proposal is ready for review and decision
- **Exit artifact**: Decision recording what was decided and why

## Relevant Files

- `Proposal.md` – The proposal being decided on
- `Decision.md` – The decision record to create
- `Templates/Decision.md` – Template to start from (if available)

## What Happens Here

1. Review the proposal with stakeholders
2. Address feedback and open questions
3. Make the decision – commit to an approach
4. Record the decision with context and rationale
5. Update proposal status to "Accepted" or "Superseded"

## Decision Principles

- Decisions are point-in-time – capture the context that led to this choice
- Record the "why" not just the "what"
- It's okay to decide with incomplete information – note what was uncertain
- A decision to not proceed is still a valid decision worth recording

## Context Update Checkpoint

Before leaving this stage, verify the Initiative's `AGENTS.md` (or your tool's context file) reflects:

- [ ] **Current State** is accurate (should be "Decide" or moving to "Decompose")
- [ ] **Key decisions** are captured (reference Decision.md for details)
- [ ] **Open Questions** resolved during decision are removed or marked resolved

This keeps context fresh for future sessions and other collaborators.

**Awaiting your direction.** What decision needs to be made?
