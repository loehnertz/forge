# Forge: Decompose Stage

You are now in the **Decompose** stage of the Forge initiative lifecycle.

## Purpose

Break the decided approach into actionable work items ready for implementation.

## Context

- **Entry trigger**: Decision made, approach committed
- **Exit artifact**: Tickets ready for the backlog

## Relevant Files

- `Decision.md` – The decision driving this work
- `Proposal.md` – Design details to reference
- `Tickets/` – Folder for ticket drafts

## What Happens Here

1. Break the proposal into discrete, implementable chunks
2. Define clear acceptance criteria for each ticket
3. Identify dependencies between tickets
4. Estimate scope and sequence work appropriately
5. Reference the proposal/decision rather than duplicating context

## Decomposition Principles

- Tickets should be independently deliverable where possible
- Include "definition of done" – how do we know it's complete?
- Don't over-specify implementation details – leave room for the implementer
- Consider creating a "spike" ticket if uncertainty remains
