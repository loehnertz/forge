# Forge: Decompose Stage

You are now in the **Decompose** stage of the Forge initiative lifecycle.

## Purpose

Break the decided approach into actionable work items ready for implementation.

## Context

- **Entry trigger**: Decision made, approach committed
- **Exit artifact**: Tickets ready for the backlog

## Relevant Files

- `Decision.md` – The decision driving this work
- `Proposal.md` – Design details to reference
- `Tickets/` – Folder for ticket drafts

## What Happens Here

1. Break the proposal into discrete, implementable chunks
2. Define clear acceptance criteria for each ticket
3. Identify dependencies between tickets
4. Estimate scope and sequence work appropriately
5. Reference the proposal/decision rather than duplicating context

## Decomposition Principles

- Tickets should be independently deliverable where possible
- Include "definition of done" – how do we know it's complete?
- Don't over-specify implementation details – leave room for the implementer
- Consider creating a "spike" ticket if uncertainty remains

## Context Update Checkpoint

Before completing this stage, verify the Initiative's `AGENTS.md` (or your tool's context file) reflects:

- [ ] **Current State** is accurate (should be "Decompose" or "Complete")
- [ ] **Key outcomes** are captured (number of tickets, implementation approach)
- [ ] **Open Questions** are resolved or transferred to ticket descriptions
- [ ] `last-reviewed` timestamp is updated

Also update the parent Product's `AGENTS.md` (or your tool's context file):

- [ ] If Initiative is complete, move to "Completed Initiatives" section or remove
- [ ] Update any architecture notes if this Initiative changed the system design

This keeps context fresh for future sessions and other collaborators.
