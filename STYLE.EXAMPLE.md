# Personal Writing Style

<!-- This file captures your personal writing preferences. Rename it to STYLE.md and customize.
     STYLE.md is gitignored – each team member can have their own without conflicts.

     These preferences override the shared Writing Conventions in AGENTS.md for writing style only.
     They do not override structural rules, folder conventions, or workflow instructions. -->

## Voice & Tone

<!-- Examples:
- Prefer a conversational tone over formal academic writing
- Avoid hedging language ("might", "could potentially") – be direct
- Use active voice; avoid passive constructions
- Keep a neutral, professional tone without being stiff
-->

## Language

<!-- Examples:
- Use British English spelling (colour, organisation, behaviour)
- Use American English spelling (color, organization, behavior)
- Prefer shorter, more common words over longer synonyms
-->

## Formatting Preferences

<!-- Examples:
- Prefer bullet lists over long prose paragraphs
- Keep sentences short – aim for 15-20 words max
- Use headers liberally to make documents scannable
- Prefer numbered lists when order matters, bullets when it doesn't
- Limit paragraphs to 3-4 sentences
-->

## Structural Preferences

<!-- Examples:
- Start every document with a TL;DR section
- Use conclusion-first / inverted pyramid structure
- End proposals with a clear "Recommendation" section
- Include a "What this does NOT cover" section in proposals
-->

## Style References

<!-- Link to documents whose writing style you want to emulate. This is often more effective than
     describing style in the abstract – the AI can learn tone, structure, and voice from examples.

     Examples:
- See Products/Analytics/Initiatives/Event-Sourcing/Proposal.md for preferred proposal style
- See https://example.com/blog-post for preferred blog tone
- Match the voice used in our public API documentation
