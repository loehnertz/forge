# Repository Paths

<!--
This file maps repository names to their local paths on your machine.
It is gitignored — each team member maintains their own copy with paths
matching their local setup.

Copy this file into each Product directory as REPOS.md and fill in the
paths where you have cloned or checked out each repository.

| Repository | Path                        |
|------------|-----------------------------|
| backend    | ~/Projects/product-backend  |
| frontend   | ~/Projects/product-frontend |
