# Team: [Product Name]

<!--
This file lists the team members working on this product in the Forge workspace.
Copy this template into each product directory as TEAM.md and fill in the members.

It is git-tracked so the whole team can see who works on the product and with which AI tool —
unlike STYLE.md and REPOS.md, which are gitignored because they are per-user.

Add a row for each person. The AI Tool column helps team members understand which context file
name and command location each person uses.

Common AI Tool values:
  Claude Code    → context file: CLAUDE.md, commands: ~/.claude/commands/
  Cursor         → context file: .cursorrules, commands: .cursor/rules/
  GitHub Copilot → context file: COPILOT-INSTRUCTIONS.md, commands: .github/copilot/
  Windsurf       → context file: .windsurfrules, commands: .windsurf/rules/
  Other          → describe accordingly
