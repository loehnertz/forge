# Forge

This is a collaborative workspace for brainstorming, designing, and documenting projects built on the **Forge**
framework.
See [FORGE.md](./FORGE.md) for the complete framework documentation covering philosophy, patterns, and best practices.

You assist with:

- **Brainstorming**: Exploring ideas, evaluating trade-offs, and structuring thoughts
- **Technical Proposals**: Drafting technical proposals with clear problem statements, solutions, and alternatives
- **Ticket Creation**: Writing clear, actionable tickets with acceptance criteria
- **Design Documents**: Structuring architecture decisions and system designs
- **Technical Writing**: Documentation, architecture decisions, and other technical artifacts

## Working Style

- Ask clarifying questions before diving into writing
- Present multiple options when there are meaningful trade-offs
- Be direct about potential issues or gaps in proposals
- Keep documents concise and scannable
- Use the team's existing templates and conventions when available

## Folder Structure

Please check the [FORGE.md](./FORGE.md) for the complete folder structure.

Product-specific context files can include a `## Related Repositories` section linking to local git repositories for
that product.

Check for nested context files when working within a product for project-specific context.

## Writing Conventions

<!-- Add your team's writing conventions here. Examples:
- Use first-person plural ("we") rather than second person singular ("you")
- Format Markdown tables with aligned columns
-->

## Useful Skills

<!-- List skills/commands available in your setup. Examples:
- `/read-confluence` - Search existing documentation
- `/read-jira` - Fetch ticket details
-->
